Google Definition: In recreational mathematics and combinatorial design, a magic square is a square grid 
  (where n is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range. 
  such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal.
  
  This is a very interesting puzzle and a phenomena in mathematics. 
  
  This code can be altered to display any magic square. 
  
  This code uses the class file "square"
