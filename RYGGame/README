Red Yellow Green Game. 

In this game you will be prompted for a guess. 
This guess will be 3 numbers (0-9), corresponding to 3 positions.
The program will then tell you the amount of green, yellow and red guesses you have (hence RYG Game).
Green means you have the correct number in the correct position.
Yellow mean you have the correct number but out of position.
Red means incorrect number.
Goal is to get all green in the least amount of guesses. GO!
