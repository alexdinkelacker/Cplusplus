Googles definition of Soundex: Soundex allows you to sort through many historic records quickly, 
                                such as old census records. The Soundex system is a useful tool in 
                                searching for ancestors because the misspelling of family names was a 
                                common occurrence in official records. As well, the spelling of family 
                                names can change over time.
In conclusion: Soundex is very powerful and can be used to create a database of names or even words that sound similar, based on their soundex code. 
It has been most useful in census records, however, this could also be useful in research areas in STEM. 
For example, in biological research, names of species get misspelled and also altered over time. However, their 
pronunciation and the sound of the species remains. This would be the ideal case for soundex as it would show the 
similarity between a misspelled or altered species name to its original spelling.
